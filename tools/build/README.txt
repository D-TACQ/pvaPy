This directory contains scripts I use for building boost/boost_numpy, pyqt, 
etc. They may rely on external websites, or source tar files. 

Note that pvaPy can use OS-provided python and/or OS-provided boost libraries.
Alternatively, it can rely on custom built python (in a non-standard location),
and/or on custom built boost libraries. pvaPy configure scripts can help
automate the build process.
